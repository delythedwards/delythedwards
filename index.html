<h2>Research interests</h2>
My research interests are centred on narratives of care and the everyday, spaces and places of home, how people (re)negotiate everyday place, memory and absent memories, the cultural ways we remember, but also more peripheral ways of remembering such as familial narrative inheritance. My methodological approach is qualitative and reflexive. I am interested in and have worked with (auto)biographical methodologies, life (hi)story ethnography and historical ethnography and archival research.

<h2>Career history</h2>
I grew up hearing stories about “the Home” from my mother. “The Home” was an orphanage in Belfast called Nazareth House, where my mother had grown up during the 1940s and 1950s. It was my fascination with these familial stories that led me to my doctoral research at Queen’s University in Belfast. The thesis, completed in 2012, was entitled The Girls of Nazareth House, 1940-1960: (Auto)biographical Understandings of Care Experiences and Identities. My research sought to explore how women who lived in the care of Nazareth House in Belfast, during the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s interpret and re-tell their (auto)biographies and the ways they (re)construct everyday experience and ontologies of the self (Hankiss 1981).
Prior to this, I gained a BScEcon in Sociology from Cardiff University in 2004 and an MA in Sociological Research from Essex University in 2006. During the following two years I worked as a research assistant at the Cardiff School of Creative and Cultural Industries at the University of Glamorgan (now known as the University of South Wales) and simultaneously worked as a research assistant on a number of freelance projects in Cardiff. I have reviewed articles submitted for publication in:Child Care in Practice (Routledge) and British Journal of Social Work (Oxford Journals). In 2013 I was asked to carry out a written evaluation of a project carried out by the Social Care Institute of Excellence (SCIE) and who collaborated with the British Library called The Care Leavers Story Project.
